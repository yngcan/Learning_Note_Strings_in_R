"Perhaps even worse is the not so uncommon believe that string manipulation is a secondary
non-relevant task. People will be impressed and will admire you for any kind of fancy model,
sophisticated algorithms, and black-box methods that you get to apply. Everybody loves the
haute cuisine of data analysis and the top notch analytics. But when it comes to processing
and manipulating strings, many will think of it as washing the dishes or pealing and cutting
potatos. If you want to be perceived as a data chef, you may be tempted to think that you
shouldn't waste your time in those boring tasks of manipulating strings. Yes, it is true that
you won't get a Michelin star for processing character data. But you would hardly become
a good data cook if you don't get your hands dirty with string manipulation. And to be
honest, it's not always that boring. Whether you like it or not, no one should ever claim
to be a data analyst until he or she has done string manipulation. You don't have to be an
expert or some string processing hacker though. But you do need to know the basics and
have an idea on how to proceed in case you need to play with text-character-string data."
